1. Make pdbs for each molecule type using cfg2pdb.f90 script

2. Use residualadder script to add some number to the pdbs that is needed

3. Set up input file. Make it so that the adsorbed molecule doesn't spawn close
   to the edge; ie set up .inp file like: 
   '1. 1. 1. 49. 49. 49.' for the adsorbed molecule in an example box that is 50x50x50
   (this notation means molecules will be put between 1 and 49 for each axis)
   In the place of 50x50x50, use your zeolite length parameters from the config.

4. ./packmol < inputfile.inp

5. Convert the final pdb 'mixture.pdb' to config using pdb2config.cpp script, instructions
   for running at the top of that script
   
6. Open in aten.

7. Click 'cell' tab, press 'periodic'. Press 'lengths' and set the unit cell 
   lengths to the same numbers from your input.inp file for the zeolite.
   
8. Rebond, check no funny business. Save, to implement your new periodic
   boundary conditions
